In this unit, you'll analyze the criteria that experts employ when they choose an Azure monitoring service for a specified business need.  By understanding the criteria, you can better assess the nuanced differences among the products.

### Do you need to analyze how you're using Azure to reduce costs?  Improve resilience?  Harden your security?

Choose Azure Advisor when you're looking for an analysis of your deployed resources.  Azure Advisor analyzes the configuration and usage of your resources and provides suggestions on how to optimize for reliability, security, performance, costs, and operations based on experts' best practices.

### Do you want to monitor Azure services or your usage of Azure?

If you want to keep tabs on Azure itself, especially the services and regions you depend on, you want to choose Azure Service Health.  You can view the current status of the Azure services you rely on, upcoming planned outages, and services that will be sunset.  You can set up alerts that help you stay on top of incidents and upcoming downtime without having to visit the dashboard regularly.

However, if you want to keep track of the performance or issues related to your specific VM or container instances, databases, your applications, and so on, you want to visit Azure Monitor and create reports and notifications to help you understand how your services are performing or diagnose issues related to your Azure usage.

### Do you want to measure custom events alongside other usage metrics?

Choose Azure Monitor when you want to measure custom events alongside other collected telemetry data.  Custom events, such as those added in the source code of your software applications, could help identify and diagnose why your application is behaving a certain way.

### Do you need to set up alerts for outages or when autoscaling is about to deploy new instances?

Here again, you would use Azure Monitor to set up alerts for key events that are related to your specific resources.
