In this module, you'll learn about the major factors that influence the cost of running in the cloud.

## How will Tailwind Traders manage cloud costs?

Tailwind Traders is planning its migration to the cloud. The company has run a few successful proof-of-concept projects and wants to better understand how to manage its costs before it moves its workloads to Azure.

Running in the datacenter requires you to maintain a facility and purchase, power, cool, and maintain your servers. Running in the cloud presents new ways to think about your IT expenses.

To answer the question of how much it will cost, you need to understand the factors that influence cost. You also need to understand what tools are available to you to help estimate and manage your cloud spend.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Use the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator to compare your current datacenter costs to running the same workloads on Azure.
* Describe the different ways you can purchase Azure products and services.
* Use the Pricing calculator to estimate the monthly cost of running your cloud workloads.
* Define some of the major factors that affect total cost, and apply recommended practices to minimize cost.

## Prerequisites

- You should be familiar with basic computing concepts and terminology.
- Familiarity with cloud computing is helpful but isn't necessary.
