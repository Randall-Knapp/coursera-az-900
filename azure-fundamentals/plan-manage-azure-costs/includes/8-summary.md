Tailwind Traders is taking a methodical approach toward cloud migration. While proof-of-concept projects can help demonstrate technical feasibility, having a clear picture of the total cost of running in the cloud will further help the team validate its approach.

To start, the Tailwind Traders team used the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator to estimate the cost savings of operating its solution on Azure instead of in its on-premises datacenter.

From there, the team used the Pricing calculator to get a more detailed estimate for running a typical workload on Azure each month.

The team also created a checklist of cost-saving measures that it can use to help keep down costs. This list includes:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Perform cost analysis before you deploy.
> * Use Azure Advisor to monitor your usage.
> * Use spending limits to prevent accidental spending.
> * Use Azure Reservations to prepay.
> * Choose low-cost locations and regions.
> * Research available cost-saving offers.
> * Apply tags to identify cost owners.

With these measures in place, the Tailwind Traders team is ready to take the next steps toward cloud migration.

## Next steps

If you run existing workloads on-premises or in the datacenter, try entering your existing workloads in the [Total Cost of Ownership Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco?azure-portal=true) to see how the cost of running on Azure compares to what you pay today.

Then, use the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/) to map your current infrastructure to cloud services. Use the [Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?azure-portal=true) to get a more accurate picture of what it would cost to run your existing workloads on Azure.

## Learn more

In this module, you learned about the many factors that affect the total cost of running on Azure.

The [Control Azure spending and manage bills with Azure Cost Management + Billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/control-spending-manage-bills/?azure-portal=true) learning path is a great next step toward learning how to monitor and control your Azure spending.
