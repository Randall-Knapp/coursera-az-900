In this module, you'll learn about service-level agreements (SLAs) in Azure and how they can affect your application design decisions. You'll also learn about the lifecycle of new Azure services, from preview to general availability.

## How will moving to the cloud affect availability agreements?

Moving to the cloud removes the burden of supporting IT infrastructure. When network connectivity is lost or a hard drive fails, you rely on the cloud provider to restore service.

Tailwind Traders' IT department hosts applications and services in its datacenter for the rest of the company. The IT department has agreements with other teams in place that state how available those services will be, which includes when and how planned maintenance can happen. As Tailwind Traders moves its workloads to Azure, it no longer has full control over the hardware and networks. How will its agreements around availability be affected?

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe what an SLA is and why SLAs are important.
* Identify factors, such as the service tier you choose, that can affect an SLA.
* Combine SLAs to compute a composite SLA.
* Describe the service lifecycle in Azure, including how to access new capabilities that are coming to Azure.

## Prerequisites

- You should be familiar with basic computing concepts and terminology.
