*Serverless computing* is a term used to describe an execution environment that's set up and managed for you.  You merely specify what you want to happen by writing code or connecting and configuring components in a visual editor, and then specify the actions that trigger your functionality, such as a timer or an HTTP request.  Best of all, you never have to worry about an outage, your code can scale instantly to meet demand, and you pay based only on the actual usage of your code.

Tailwind Traders, a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer, has found success selling online.  The company sees several opportunities to improve its e-commerce website.
