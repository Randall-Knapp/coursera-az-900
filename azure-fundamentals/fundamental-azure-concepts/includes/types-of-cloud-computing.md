## What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

There are three deployment models for cloud computing: *public cloud*, *private cloud*, and *hybrid cloud*. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.

| <nobr>Deployment model</nobr> | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <nobr>**Public cloud**</nobr> | Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet. |
| <nobr>**Private cloud**</nobr> | A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. |
| <nobr>**Hybrid cloud**</nobr> | A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. |

The following image illustrates several of the cloud computing concepts that are presented in this unit. In this example, several factors are demonstrated when you are considering where to deploy a database server in a hybrid cloud environment: as your resources move from on-premises to off-premises, your costs are reduced, and your administration requirements decrease.
