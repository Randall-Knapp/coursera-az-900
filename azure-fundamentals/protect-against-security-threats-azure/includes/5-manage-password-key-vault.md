In this exercise, you add a password to Azure Key Vault. A password is an example of sensitive information that you need to protect. You then read the password from Azure Key Vault to verify that the password is accessible.

In practice, there are several ways to add secrets to and read secrets from Key Vault. You can use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. By using your favorite programming language, your applications can also securely access the secrets that they need.

Here, you create a secret in Key Vault by using the Azure portal. You then access the secret from the portal and from the Azure CLI in Azure Cloud Shell. 

The Azure CLI is a way to work with Azure resources from the command line or from scripts. Cloud Shell is a browser-based shell experience to manage and develop Azure resources. Think of Cloud Shell as an interactive console that runs in the cloud.

## Create a key vault

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.

1. From the search bar, enter **Key Vault**. Then select **Key Vault** from the results.

1. On the **Key Vault** pane, select **Create**.

1. On the **Create key vault** pane, fill in these settings:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace *NNN* with a series of numbers. This helps ensure that the name of your key vault is unique.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Concierge Subscription** |
    | Resource group | **<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>** |
    | Key vault name | **my-kv-NNN** |

    Leave the other settings at their current values.

1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

    Wait for the creation process to finish.

1. Select **Go to resource**.

1. Note some of the details about your key vault.

    For example, the **DNS name** field shows the URI that your application can use to access your vault from the REST API.

    Here's an example for a key vault that's named **my-kv-1234**:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-portal-key-vault-overview.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Azure portal showing details about a key vault. It shows fields such as the parent resource group, location, and DNS name.":::

1. As an optional step, under **Settings**, examine some of the other settings.

    Although they're initially empty, here you'll find places where you can store keys, secrets, and certificates.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your Azure subscription is the only one that's authorized to access this vault. Under **Settings**, the **Access policies** section enables you to configure access to the vault.

## Add a password to the key vault

1. Under **Settings**, select **Secrets**, and then select **Generate/Import**.
1. On the **Create a secret** pane, fill in these settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Upload options | **Manual** |
    | Name | **MyPassword** |
    | Value | **hVFkk96** |

    Leave the other settings at their default values. But notice that you can specify properties such as the activation date and the expiration date. You can also disable access to the secret.

1. Select **Create**.

## Show the password

Here, you access the password from Key Vault two times. First, you access it from the Azure portal. Then you access it from the Azure CLI.

1. From your Key Vault, select **MyPassword**.

    You see that the current version is enabled.

1. Select the current version.

    Under **Secret Identifier**, you see a URI that you can now use with applications to access the secret. Remember, only authorized applications can access this secret.

1. Select **Show Secret Value**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-portal-secret-value.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Azure portal showing the secret value in the key vault.":::

1. From the Cloud Shell pane to the side of the screen, run this command.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're not familiar with the Azure CLI, just follow along.

    ```azurecli
    az keyvault secret show \
      --name "MyPassword" \
      --vault-name $(az keyvault list --query [0].name --output tsv) \
      --query value \
      --output tsv
    ```

    You see the password in the output:

    ```output
    hVFkk96
    ```

Good work! At this point, you have a key vault that contains a password secret that's securely stored for use with your applications.
