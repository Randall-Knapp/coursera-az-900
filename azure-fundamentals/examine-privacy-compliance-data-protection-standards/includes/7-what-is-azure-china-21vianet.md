[Azure China 21Vianet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/china?azure-portal=true) is operated by 21Vianet. It's a physically separated instance of cloud services located in China. Azure China 21Vianet is independently operated and transacted by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. 

According to the China Telecommunication Regulation, providers of cloud services, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), must have value-added telecom permits. Only locally registered companies with less than 50 percent foreign investment qualify for these permits. To comply with this regulation, the Azure service in China is operated by 21Vianet, based on the technologies licensed from Microsoft.

## Azure products and services available in China

The Azure services are based on the same Azure, Office 365, and Power BI technologies that make up the Microsoft global cloud service, with comparable service levels. Azure agreements and contracts in China, where applicable, are signed between customers and 21Vianet.

Azure includes the core components of IaaS, PaaS, and software as a service (SaaS). These components include network, storage, data management, identity management, and many other services.

Azure China 21Vianet supports most of the same services that global Azure has, such as geosynchronous data replication and autoscaling. Even if you already use global Azure services, to operate in China you might need to rehost or refactor some or all your applications or services.
